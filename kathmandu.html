                        </figcaption>
                        <p>Kathmandu is the Capital city of Nepal. It is the most populated and crowded city in Nepal. With that population there comes a lot of opportunities, places, and things to do. When you are in Kathmandu I bet you, you won’t be bored
                            any single day.</p>
                        <p>Kathmandu has so much to offer places, offices, universities, park, museum, nightlife and many more. So, let us look at some of the things that we can do in Kathmandu in our spare.</p>
                        <h4> 1. Visit Thamel</h4>
                        <p>Thamel is the most vibrant places in Kathmandu, and it turns out to be the most famous tourist destination. In Thamel, there are hundreds of shops selling Nepali items from art, craft, sculpture, paintings to Nepali clothing’s,
                            hiking, trekking equipment and many more. When it gets dark, then only we will see the real vibes of Themel. Packed with hotels, restaurants, pubs, and bar, you will see more people having quality time there. Nightlife is the
                            best time to enjoy in Thamel. Most of the restaurants are opened till 12 am while clubs and pubs play music till 2 to 4 am.</p>
                        <h4> 2. Visiting Garden of Dreams</h4>
                        <p>Garden of Dreams is located at the entrance of Thamel. This garden as the name says “Garden of Dreams” is a dream garden. This garden is planted with beautiful floras. Ponds, fountains, greenery is the perfect spot to cherish the
                            serenity. Garden of dreams is a popular destination place in Kathmandu.</p>
                        <h4>3. Explore the Boudhanath Stupa</h4>
                        <p>Being one of the largest stupas in all of Nepal, the Boudhanath Stupa, is certainly one of the best things to do in Kathmandu (especially if you’re interested in religious history). Once here, make sure to wander around the complex,
                            and explore this point that was on the old trade route with Tibet. All around the Stupa, you’ll find lots of little shops and cafes, too. It’s a beautiful and imposing stupa that you’ve gotta see whilst in Kathmandu.</p>
                        <h4>4. Visit the Pashupatinath Temple</h4>
                        <p>Located in the city itself, Pashupatinath Temple is a Hindu temple that’s one of the best things to do in Kathmandu. This sacred place is known the world-over by Hindus, with millions visiting here during Maha Shivaratri. The whole
                            temple complex is huge and sprawling and a beautiful place to see whilst in the city. Now, as a visitor to the complex, you will need to pay a considerably higher price than locals (but still affordable) to enter the complex.
                            Once inside, wander around, explore the religious sites and experience this sacred place.</p>
                        <h4>5. Strolling around Ason and Indrachowk</h4>
                        <p>Ason and Indrachowk are famous markets near Thamel. One of the best places for finding typical Nepali souvenir and Nepali food, this place carries a lot of Nepali history. This bustling and crowded areas might reward you will its
                            beauty and originality.</p>
                        <h4>6. Visit the famous Narayanhiti Place Museum</h4>
                        <p>Narayanhiti was a royal home of former kings of Nepal. And, now it has been turned into Museum. This place perfectly presents how our king lived in the past and how significant history it carries. The walk into the Museum will
                            surely amaze you</p>
